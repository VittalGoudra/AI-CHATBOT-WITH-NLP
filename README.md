PROJECT DESCRIPTION:



This project focuses on developing an AI-powered chatbot that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. By integrating NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy, the chatbot can process human language, analyze intent, and provide meaningful, context-aware answers. The chatbot can be applied in various domains like customer support, education, healthcare, and personal assistance.



TECHNOLOGIES USED:



Programming Language: Python

NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy

Machine Learning Frameworks (optional): Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Web Framework (optional for deployment): Flask / Django

Database (optional): SQLite / MySQL / MongoDB




OBJECTIVES:



To design and implement a chatbot capable of understanding natural language queries.

To use NLP techniques for intent recognition and text preprocessing.

To enhance user experience with context-aware and accurate responses.

To provide a scalable and customizable chatbot for various applications.




FEATURES:




Natural Language Understanding: Ability to process and interpret user queries.

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal.

Intent Recognition: Classification of user input into different intents.

Entity Recognition: Identifying key entities (e.g., names, dates, locations).

Predefined Responses: Handling FAQs and common queries.

Contextual Responses (optional): Maintaining conversation flow.

Scalability: Easy integration with websites, mobile apps, or messaging platforms.

Customizability: Can be trained for specific domains such as customer service, healthcare, or education.
